Created a user-friendly platform for seamless 1-to-1 medical appointment scheduling between clinics and patients. Engineered a dynamic queue management system that allows patients to view real-time queue status, book appointments, and receive estimated wait times (averaging 10 minutes per patient), while enabling doctors to efficiently monitor and update clinic queues.
