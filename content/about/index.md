Hello! I'm Gitesh, Software Engineer based out of Delhi.

I love building things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

I worked at [Shop2App](https://www.shop2app.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern where I collaborated with the Founding Engineering team to develop an [App](https://apps.shopify.com/shop2app-mobile-app-builder) which is live on the Shopify App Store. Prior to this, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at [Consainsights](https://consainsights.com/), a Management Consulting firm. Additionally, I have freelanced, working on various projects with my seniors.

I along with my team have won [MLH Hack this Fall S2](https://hackthisfall-2.devpost.com/). We build CodeMate a peer to peer coding platform where you can code with your mates and solve doubts together.

I also founded [CodingVets](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codingvets/), a college community of active peers that aims at bridging the gap between newbies and pros, fostering a supportive coding culture with the motto "Learn Together, Grow Together"

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
